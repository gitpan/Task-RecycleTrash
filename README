NAME
    Task::RecycleTrash - Check/install the dependencies for
    File::Remove::trash

DESCRIPTION
    The trash function was added to File::Remove to provide access to
    various operating system's native "holding area" for deleted files.

    On Mac OS X this is known as the "trash" bin, on Windows this is known
    as the "recycle" bin.

    Unfortunately, the dependencies needed to interact with this
    functionality can be quite difficult in several cases, most notably on
    Mac OS X where the Mac::Glue (and thus Mac::Carbon) module is needed.

    This created the rediculous situation in which a Mac OS X machine would
    need to install and (audibly) test a voice synthesis engine in order to
    add the capability to reliably delete a file.

    To resolve this problem, the "trash" functionality in File::Remove will
    ultimately be moved to a seperate distribution, but in the short term
    the dependencies for the trash function will simply not be declared.

    Task::RecycleTrash provides a replacement dependency for people that
    genuinely do need to use the trash function in File::Remove.

    It will install the dependencies needed on each platform, and then run
    some simple tests to ensure that the trash function is working as
    intended.
